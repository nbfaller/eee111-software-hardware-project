This project consists of a program which emulates the facial recognition capabilities of "Snapchat",
wherein users may apply filters on their faces using the webcam feed.

Facial recognition capability is done using the facial_recognition Python library.

The filter takes inspiration from the "Confused Math Lady" meme - an internet phenomenon of a woman
visibly confused with overlays of different math equations on the frame. The filter consists of a
variety of allusions to Electrical, Computer, and Electronics Engineering such as circuit symbols and formulae.
